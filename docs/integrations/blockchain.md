# Azure Blockchain Service,

Probably go with Corda.

Corda is more focused on business processes and does not have a native concept of tokens like Ethereum. However, you can create and manage states that represent assets.

Steps to Create a Custom Asset on Corda

1. Set Up Azure Blockchain Service:
    • Create a new instance of Azure Blockchain Service and choose Corda as your blockchain protocol.
2. Write a Contract for Your Asset:
    • In Corda, you define states, contracts, and flows. Here’s an example of a simple asset state:

    ```java
    import net.corda.core.contracts.CommandData;
    import net.corda.core.contracts.Contract;
    import net.corda.core.contracts.ContractState;
    import net.corda.core.identity.AbstractParty;
    import net.corda.core.transactions.LedgerTransaction;

    import java.util.Collections;
    import java.util.List;

    public class MyAsset implements ContractState {
        private final AbstractParty owner;
        private final int value;

        public MyAsset(AbstractParty owner, int value) {
            this.owner = owner;
            this.value = value;
        }

        public AbstractParty getOwner() {
            return owner;
        }

        public int getValue() {
            return value;
        }

        @Override
        public List<AbstractParty> getParticipants() {
            return Collections.singletonList(owner);
        }
    }

    public class MyAssetContract implements Contract {
        @Override
        public void verify(LedgerTransaction tx) {
            // Contract verification logic
        }

        public interface Commands extends CommandData {
            class Issue implements Commands {}
        }
    }
    ```

 Ethereum is a popular choice for creating custom tokens due to its robust support for smart contracts and token standards such as ERC-20 and ERC-721.

Steps to Create Your Own Token on Ethereum via Azure Blockchain Service

1. Set Up Azure Blockchain Service:
    • Go to the Azure portal and create a new instance of Azure Blockchain Service.
    • Choose Ethereum as your blockchain protocol.
2. Write a Smart Contract for Your Token:
    • Use Solidity to write a smart contract for your custom token. Below is an example of an ERC-20 token contract:

    ```sol
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

    contract MyToken is ERC20 {
        constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
            _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
        }
    }
    ```

3. Deploy the Smart Contract:
    • Use a tool like Truffle or the Azure Blockchain Development Kit to compile and deploy your token contract to the Azure Blockchain Service.

    ```sh
    truffle migrate --network azure
    ```

4. Interact with Your Token:
    • Once deployed, you can interact with your token contract using Web3.js or any Ethereum-compatible wallet.
