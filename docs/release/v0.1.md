User Authentication and Authorization
	•	Azure Active Directory (Azure AD): Use Azure AD B2C for user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and interact with the application.
	2.	File Upload and Storage
	•	Azure Blob Storage: Users will upload their files to a designated blob storage container. This service offers scalable, secure, and durable storage for large amounts of unstructured data, such as files.
	3.	Event Handling on File Upload
	•	Azure Event Grid: Configure Azure Event Grid to trigger events when a new file is uploaded to the blob storage. This service will listen for blob creation events and notify other services to start processing the file.

    Data Analysis and Querying
	•	Azure Synapse Analytics: For advanced analytics and large-scale data processing, use Azure Synapse Analytics. It integrates with Azure Data Factory and can handle large volumes of data with powerful querying capabilities.
